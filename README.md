Deutsche Bank Belgium Root Detection Bypasser


How to use it
-------------

First, you need [XPosed framework](http://xposed.info), then install the module
via XPosed's download tab and reboot. That's it.


Why do I need this module
-------------------------

I have a rooted Android phone mostly to improve security and privacy and I
recommend everybody who cares about that to do the same. This DB app exits with
this error message:

> You can't log in because your smartphone doesn't meet the security
> requirements. Please call 078 155 153 for more information.

Feel free to call this phone number or use this XPosed module if you trust your
rooted Android device.
